Artisan's AccordArtisan's Accord is a resource generation mod for Minecraft that asks the question: "What if villagers could run a factory?" Instead of magic blocks, this mod introduces a deep, progression-based economy where you, the player, build and manage a community of skilled artisans to automate the production of resources.From a single hand-cranked drill to a sprawling, fully automated factory floor, Artisan's Accord provides a unique and engaging journey focused on clever design, logistical challenges, and rewarding automation.‚ú® Core FeaturesTwo New Villager Professions: Hire the Geologist to prospect for mineral resources and the Artisan to refine them into usable materials.Multi-Block Workstations: Build and upgrade impressive, functional multi-block structures like the Prospecting Drill and the modular Workshop. Your factory's progression is visual!Deep Ore Processing: Go beyond simple smelting. Build specialized workshop stations to create production lines that can double, triple, or even quintuple your ingot yield from a single mineral sample.Villager Management: Your workers have needs! Manage their Stamina, Tools, and Happiness to create an efficient and productive community. Build them break rooms and keep them supplied with tools to maximize uptime.Server & Modpack Friendly: Designed from the ground up to be server-friendly and highly compatible, with a simple but powerful API for other developers to integrate their own resources.üöÄ Getting StartedYour journey to becoming an industrial magnate begins with a few simple steps.Hire a Geologist: Craft a Geology Table and place it in a village to create the Geologist profession. Trade with them to get your first tools.Build the Drill: Construct the Tier 1 Prospecting Drill, a manual, hand-cranked machine. Assign your Geologist to it and provide them with Drill Bits. They will begin to slowly produce Mineral Samples based on the ores in that chunk.Establish a Workshop: Craft an Artisan's Bench to attract an Artisan. Build them a basic Workshop with a Crusher and Smelter around an Assembly Anvil.Start Production: Give the Artisan a Mineral Sample and the right tools (like a Hammer). They will begin processing the sample into dust and then into ingots, effectively doubling your resources!Automate and Scale: From here, your goal is to automate. Power your drill with Redstone Flux, pipe items between machines, automatically craft and repair tools for your villagers, and expand your workshop to unlock even greater yields.üíæ InstallationThis is a Forge mod.Ensure you have the latest version of Minecraft Forge for 1.21 installed.Download the latest version of Artisan's Accord from CurseForge or Modrinth.Place the downloaded .jar file into your mods folder.Launch the game!ü§ù For Developers & Modpack MakersCompatibility is a core design goal.
